            <p class="blogparagraph">Although we know everythings have the two sides in the same way technology has clearly improved the grocery business in many ways, there are disadvantages and difficulties associated with it as well. The possibility of employment is among the most urgent worries. The pervasiveness of artificia intelligence and artificial intelligence in grocery business poses a significant risk to employment, especially for positions requiring regular and repeated work. Workers's livelihoods are mostly impacted and the community attachment has also been decreased because of the advancement technology in the grocery which makes us to buy just with the few clicks.
            </p>
<br>
            <p class="blogparagraph">Privacy concerns is the another significant disadvantage of technology for the food industry. Concerns about the security and privacy of personal data are developing as a result of the significant gathering and use of customer data via online sales, online sales, and digital marketing campaigns. Another disadvantages is the mishandling or unauthorized access to private information puts grocery stores' reputations at risk and puts at risk consumer trust.
            </p>
<br>
            <p class="blogparagraph">Furthermore, inequalities in access to necessities are made worse by the digital services. While individuals with access to digital devices and high-speed internet enjoy unparalleled convenience, but on the other hand people with the less internet speed and not good digital services feel excluded by technology at the same time. Their inability to fully engage in the digital economy is hampered by this digital rejection, which also maintains the gaps in their access to reasonably priced and healthful food options . The people can't decide the quality of foods or vegetables just by looking from the products picture on the smartphone.</p>

 <br>           
            <p class="blogparagraph">The durability and stability of grocery store operations are also significantly threatened by a reliance on technology. Businesses that rely too much on digital infrastructure and automated processes are more susceptible to disruptions from cyberattacks, power outages, and other technical issues. Businesses may experience major downtime, lost revenue, and reputational harm in the event of such interruptions, which emphasizes the significance of having strong backup plans and spending money on cybersecurity protections.</p>
